# Bloc Jams Angular

Bloc Jams is an SPA designed in Bloc's Front End portion of their web development bootcamp.
This is a refactor of Bloc Jams from jQuery to AngularJS. The Bloc Jams app was first created in JavaScript, then refactored in jQuery, and last in AngularJS for learning purposes.
The original Bloc Jams can be found at my [Bloc Jams Repo.](https://github.com/aaronkoz74/bloc-jams)
